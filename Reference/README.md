In sub-section 6.1: _Estimate SS WD278m_ of the [compute guide document](/Wind-turbine-long-term-energy-forecast_Compute-guide.pdf), we apply the so-called "mean offset" approach which is mentionned in this [book](/Reference/Wind%20Resource%20Assessment%20-%20A%20Practical%20Guide%20to%20Developing%20a%20Wind%20Project_Michael%20Brower%20_Wiley%20(2012).pdf) (12.4.4 - _ Direction and Other Parameters_, p.173)

> It is usually not necessary to use MCP to predict the target directional distribution,
so long as there is at least a year of directional data from the target site. Where the
on-site observations are inadequate, the simplest solution is to Ô¨Ånd the mean offset
between the concurrent reference and target directions for each reference direction
sector and apply that offset to the full reference data record.
